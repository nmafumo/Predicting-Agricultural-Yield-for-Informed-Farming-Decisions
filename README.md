# Predicting-Agricultural-Yield-for-Informed-Farming-Decisions

This project delves into a massive agricultural dataset to uncover the secrets of maximising crop yield. We'll embark on a journey of discovery, analysing the intricate relationships between various factors that influence crop growth. These factors include:

Geographic location: Where the crops are grown can significantly impact yield due to variations in climate and soil composition.
Weather patterns: Rainfall, temperature, and other weather elements play a crucial role in crop health and productivity.
Soil characteristics: The chemical and physical properties of the soil directly influence nutrient availability for plants.
Farm management practices: Planting decisions, fertilization techniques, and pest control strategies all contribute to yield outcomes.

Our ultimate goal is to decode these complex relationships and empower farmers with actionable insights. By analysing this data, we aim to:

**Uncover Hidden Patterns:**
We will explore how the predictor variables like geographic location, weather, soil properties, and farm management practices are intertwined with crop yield (the target variable).

**Prepare the Data for Analysis:**
We will transform the data into a format suitable for modeling by handling categorical variables and ensuring all features are on the same scale.

**Build Predictive Models:**
We will construct and evaluate multiple linear regression models to identify the most significant factors influencing crop yield.

**Address Challenges:**
We will tackle potential issues like multicollinearity (when features are highly correlated) using techniques like LASSO and Ridge regression.

**Interpret Results:**
We will decipher the meaning of the regression coefficients to understand how each factor affects crop yield.

**Explore Alternative Models:** 
We will venture beyond linear models by implementing decision tree algorithms that can handle both categorical and numerical data for prediction.

**Evaluate Model Performance:**
We will calculate and interpret metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) to assess how accurately our models predict crop yield.

Through this comprehensive analysis, we aim to equip farmers with valuable knowledge to optimise their crop yields and make informed decisions for a more productive and sustainable future.
